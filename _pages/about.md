I am a PhD candidate supervised by [Prof. Tang Kai](https://mektang.people.ust.hk/), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  Before joining Prof.Tang's group, I was a research assistant in [Prof.Kim's group](https://seng.ust.hk/about/people/faculty/jang-kyo-kim) on Li-S battery. Prior to this, I received B.E. in the School of Mechatronics Engineering of Harbin Institute of Technology.

As a researcher in CAD/CAM, I mainly focus on model decomposition, curve layers generation and path planning in additive manufacturing. My research interests also include robotics, computer graphics.
